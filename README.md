Delivering Results
To deliver the results of your analysis, you will submit a written analysis created for your CEO, V. Isualize, in the form of a README.md file on your GitHub repository. In your README.md, you should have three paragraphs consisting of 4 to 5 sentences each.

The first paragraph should include the following:

Describe the purpose, or the reason, you did this assignment.
How did you analyze the data to create the technical deliverables?
What can be said about the summary DataFrame and multiple-line graph with respect to the ride-sharing data among the different city types? Include images of the summary DataFrame table and the multiple-line graph in these results.
A short summary of the results.

The second paragraph should include the following:

What challenges or difficulties did you encounter? If none, then briefly explain what challenges or difficulties may be encountered and how to avoid them using technical analysis.
Explain how you overcame any challenges or difficulties, and include what technical analysis you use to overcome the challenges or difficulties.

The third paragraph should include the following:

Based on the data from the different city types, what recommendations would you give the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types?
Provide two additional analyses you could do to gain more insight into the data, like using other datasets.
What technical steps would you take to perform the additional analyses?



In the summary it shows that Urban areas has the maximum amount of drivers and riders.  Combining the two they compile the greatest amount of fares.  The general fare per rider is greater in the rural and suburban areas.  These two areas are the most productive.  Please see summary below.

          Total Rides     Total Drivers     Total Fares     Average Fare per Ride     Average Fare per Driver
Rural           125                 537      $4,327.93                      $34.62                      $8.06
Suburban        625                8570     $19,356.33                      $30.97                      $2.26
Urban           1625              59602     $39,854.38                      $24.53                      $0.67

The challenges I encountered was putting together the codes to create the data.  You cannot avoid the challenges, you have study the data and use the technology to make easer for us.  You have to overcome anything that is presented to you, same here you analys the data and start building our code and let the program do the rest, that is if you enter the correct code.  

Based on the data presented in front of you Total Fares come in greatest in the urban areas due to the high number of rides.  Drivers in the Rural and Suburban areas have the greatest profitability, this may be due to the greatest fare amounts.  The Urban areas stay quit active with reduced fares.  I would of probably used a Pie Chat instead of the FiveThirtyEight graph style.
